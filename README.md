- [Exploring the Dynamics of COVID-19: ](https://github.com/narendranush/nara-portfolio/blob/main/exploring-covid19-dataset/Exploring_The_Dynamics_of_COVID_19.ipynb) For my project titled "Exploring the Dynamics of COVID-19: A Global Analysis of Confirmed Cases, Deaths, and Recoveries" by me, Narendra Nusantara Handradika, I'm delving into the COVID-19 pandemic's far-reaching effects. This pandemic has had a profound impact on the world, affecting individuals, communities, and nations. Analyzing COVID-19 data has become crucial for governments, healthcare professionals, researchers, and the general public. My project aims to provide insights into the dynamics of the global COVID-19 pandemic by exploring and analyzing relevant data.
- [Resilience through Visualization: Tackling Recession with UMKMs - Tableau: ](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/salomo.hendrian.sudjono/viz/qwerty_16667164411500/MempertahankandanMengembangkanUMKMdikalaResesi2023_1) This is my project with my colleague Salomo Hendrian, which was entered into and selected as one of the top 10 finalists at the Jabar Data Viz Festival 2022. This is an illustration idea where we relied on conceptual and declarative analysis. We chose the theme of 'Recession,' which was a hot topic at the time. In our opinion, Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (UMKM) can be one of the solutions to deal with a potential recession, especially since Indonesia is the number one country in ASEAN with the highest number of UMKMs.
- [Unlocking Stock Price Predictions - Deep Learning (LSTM): ](https://github.com/narendranush/nara-portfolio/blob/main/stock-prediction/Unlock_Stock_Price_Predictions.ipynb) In this project, I embarked on a journey into the fascinating realm of data science, inspired by the visionary William S. Cleveland who expanded the horizons of statistics into the technical domain. My mission: to develop an application that assists companies in predicting stock prices. Armed with a dataset sourced from Yahoo Finance through the yfinance Python package, I found myself equipped with historical daily price data for several technology sector stocks, stretching up to April 1, 2020.
